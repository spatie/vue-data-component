**Work in progress!**

`vue-data-component` is a renderless component to build data-driven interfaces. Especially interfaces that contain filterable, sortable, or paginated data. We wanted to build something that takes care of pesky little problems like loading indicators, debouncing, or mapping your interface's filters to an AJAX request.

A brief overview of what `vue-data-component` has to offer:

- Filter, sort, and paginate data via AJAX or from any other data source
- Sync the component state with the current URL's query string
- Debounce asynchronous requests
- Handle loading indicators. No unnecessary flashes, only display them if the request is taking too long
- Pass initial data for the component's first render when fetching data asynchronously, avoids layout jumps on first render when the data isn't loaded yet
- Renderless: build your own interface, we don't make any assumptions
- Additional helper components for sorting, pagination, and facet filters

On their own, none of these features are super impressive, but together they enable you to build better interfaces in a uniform approach.

## Changelog

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information what has changed recently.

## Installation

With npm:

```
npm install vue-data-component
```

With yarn:

```
yarn add vue-data-component
```

This package contains a few components. You can register them all globally by installing this package as a plugin.

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueDataComponent from 'vue-data-component';

Vue.use(VueDataComponent);
```

Alternatively, you can import the ones you need separately.

```js
import {
    DataComponent,
    QueryComponent,
    DataSortToggle,
    DataFilter,
    DataPaginator,
} from 'vue-data-component';
```

### Polyfills

`vue-data-component` expects the following browser API's to be available. If you need wider browser support, you'll need to add a polyfill.

- `Promise` ([Can I use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=promises))
- `Array.from` ([ES compat](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-Array.from))

## Usage

This package exposes two main components: `with-data` and `with-query`. `with-data` is a low-level component that expects a function that returns a promise as it's data source. `with-query` does more out of the box. It requires an endpoint URL prop, and will call that URL with a query string to update it's data set.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `source`* | `Function` | (required) | This function will be called to fetch data. It receives an object parameter: `{ query, queryString }`. The function should return a [response object](#response-objects). The response object mayb be wrapped in a promise. |
| `query` | `Object` | `{}` | A [query object](#query-objects). A deep watcher will be registered on the query object to determine when new data should be fetched. |
| `initial` | `Object` or `null` | `null` | An initial [response object](#response-objects) so the component can render as soon as possible. |
| `debounceMs` | `Number` | `0` | Data wont be subsequently fetched until the debounce time has passed. |
| `slowRequestMs` | `Number` | `0` | Requests that take longer than `slowRequestMs` will be considered slow. See [Handling slow requests](#handling-slow-requests). |
| `useQueryString` | `Boolean` | `false` | When `true`, the browser's query string will be updated based on the current query. See [Query strings](#query-strings).  This prop is currently not supported with SSR. |
| `queryStringDefaults` | `Object` or `null` | `null` | The default values for the query string. When these values match the current `query` values, they will be omitted from the query string. For example, you generally don't want `page=1` in your URL's, since it has the same effect as no `page` parameter. |
